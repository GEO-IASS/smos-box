<h3>Flag Descriptor Format</h3>

<p>
    The DDDB flag descriptor file is used to define the set of flags and the display properties of the flags for SMOS
    data structures that contain flag data.
    The flag descriptor file is a line based text file (comma separated file) that is using the vertical-bar character (<i>
    &#124;</i>) as separator.
    A line beginning with a number-sign (<i>&#035; </i>) is treated as comment line.
</p>
The following table lists all properties that may be used to describe a flag.

    <tr>
        <th>visible</th>
        <th>visible</th>
