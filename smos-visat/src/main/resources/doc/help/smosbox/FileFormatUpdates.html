<h3>SMOS Data File Format</h3>

<p>
    The data format for SMOS products supported by SMOS box is the Earth Explorer Ground Segment File Format
    (EE-Format).
    This data format consists of an ASCII XML header file (*.HDR) and a binary data block file (*.DBL).
    <br>
    The binary data structures contained in the data block file are described in the schema-files that are available
    from ESA.
    This approach allows software reading SMOS files to automatically decode the data correctly.
</p>

<h4>SMOS Product Reader</h4>

<p>
    The SMOS Product Reader uses a dynamic approach to adapt the data structures read from the product file to the data
    format used in BEAM and displayed in Visat. This dynamic approach is implemented by using a set of descriptor files
    for each product and file version that define the content of the product and the way the data is extracted from the
    EE files.
</p>

<p>
    This large set of versioned descriptor files is bundled in a <i>Data Descriptor Data Base</i> (DDDB). The Product
    Reader
    extracts the schema information from the SMOS-EE header file and consults the DDDB about the structure and content
    of the product to be read.
</p>

<h5>DDDB</h5>
The core of the DDDB consists of a large number of configuration files that define the decoding and display properties
of the various file types supported. It is organised using the following directory structure:

<p><img src="images/DDDBFileTree.png" alt="DDDB directory structure"/></p>

The root directory for the DDDB in the example above is called <i>dddb</i>. It contains three sub-folders: <i>bands</i>,
<i>flags</i> and <i>schemas</i> that contain the settings for the bands, flags and the schema files.
Each of these folders contains two sub-folders for MIRAS (<i>MIR_</i>) and auxiliary data (<i>AUX_</i>) product data
file descriptors.
These folders contain a further sub-division according to the product type:

<p><img src="images/DDDBTypeDirectories.png" alt="DDDB type directories"/></p>

<p>
    Each of the product type directories contains the versioned descriptor files for this product type.
</p>

<h5>Extending the DDDB</h5>

<p>
    The standard content of the DDDB is contained as a Java resource and shipped with the SMOS-Box software. This set of
    band and flag descriptors is thoroughly tested and compliant with all file format versions including and prior to
    the latest
    version noted in the software change notes.
