<h3>SMOS NetCDF Conversion</h3>


<p>The NetCDF Conversion Command can be used to convert the data of
    SMOS products in Earth Explorer file format to NetCDF.
    This conversion process involves a re-sampling of the data from
    the original ISEA hexagonal data cells to a rectangular raster file format.
</p>

<h4>NetCDF Output File Format</h4>

<p>
    The target file format for the conversion process is NetCDF-CF format using a compressed
    NetCDF-4 file format. General information about the NetCDF-4 format can be found at
    <br>
    <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">UNIDATA NetCDF (Network Common Data Form)</a>
    <br>
    The CF (Climate and Forecast Metadata) format convention is described at
    <br>
    <a href="http://cf-pcmdi.llnl.gov/">CF Metadata</a>
</p>
<p>
    All fields in the SMOS EE grid point data records are represented as single bands on a
    rectangular pixel raster.
    The raster is a Plate-Carree projection with a pixel size of 0.02197 degrees in both axes.
    <br>
    The Metadata of the original Earth-Explorer file is converted to a CF-compliant metadata
    record and stored as global NetCDF attribute.
</p>

<h4>Conversion Process</h4>
<b>TODO</b> describe re-sampling, handling of L1C files ...
<br>
<b>TODO</b> emphasize the importance to process subsets ... lot of no-data-cells, slow ...

<p><b>Source Products:</b> Either the SMOS product selected in
    VISAT, or all SMOS products residing in a directory of the file
    system can be used for exporting. The search for SMOS products
    may optionally include subdirectories.</p>

<b>TODO</b>
Describe GUI components

<b>TODO</b>
Describe GPF integration and supply example for GPF-xml input format
