In 'fs1/projects/ongoing/smos-box/software/adffgrid' there is a module
for mapping between the SMOS ADFF grid and BEAM image pixels.

The module is not used though, because the performance gained is about
15 percent only, which is not too much when compared with the overhead
of about 80 MB compressed disk storage required by the module.
