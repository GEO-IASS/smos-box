  <h3>SMOS-Box</h3>

  <h4>Introduction</h4>

  <p>The BEAM SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order
  to support users of data acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and
  Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. BEAM and the SMOS-Box are user
  tools which ESA/ESRIN are providing free of charge to the Earth
  Observation Community.</p>

  <p>The SMOS-Box software has been developed by <a href=
  "http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a> under
  ESA contract initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated
  Peter Regner (ESRIN).</p>

  <p>This document set provides the online help for Version 1.0 of
  the SMOS-Box.</p>

  <h4>Supported Data Products</h4>

  <p>Version 1.0 of the BEAM SMOS-Box is capable of reading SMOS
  data products complying with Schemas Release
  2009-06-02_v04-03-09. The SMOS-Box exclusively supports the
  following product types:</p>

  <h4>Tools</h4>

  <p>Version 1.0 of the SMOS-Box also includes five SMOS-specific
  tools:</p>

  <ol>
    <li><a href="Tools.html">Grid point brightness temperature data
    table</a>: all measurements made for the grid point selected by
    either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a
    table.</li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html">Grid point brightness temperature flag
    matrix diagram</a>: all flags associated with the measurements
    made for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or
    a selected pin are displayed in a flag matrix.</li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html">Grid point brightness temperature
    chart</a>: All brightness temperatures measured for the grid
    point selected by either the mouse pointer or a selected pin
    are displayed in a chart.</li>

    <li><a href="Tools.html">Snapshot information tool</a>:
    Information for all snapshots contained in a Level-1c Science
    product can be browsed with a slider.</li>

    <li><a href="GridCellExport.html">Grid point export tool</a>:
    Exports all data for a user-defined set of SMOS grid points
    into a plain text file.</li>
  </ol>

  <h4>Known Limitations</h4>

  <p>Version 1.0 of the SMOS-Box has the following known
  limitations:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>All SMOS data products are represented as global products
    covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore SMOS
    products do not have a geographical boundary.</li>

    <li>Due to the representation of SMOS products as a global
    product, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes crossing
    the anti-meridian.</li>

    <li>Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use
    image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point data.</li>
  </ol>
