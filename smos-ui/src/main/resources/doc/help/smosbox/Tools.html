<h3>SMOS-Box Tools</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
    Readers not familiar with the SMOS-Box software might read the <a href="Introduction.html">Introduction
    to the SMOS-Box</a> and the explanation of the representation of <a href="DataModel.html">SMOS Data in
    BEAM</a> first.
</p>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
    Version 1.0 of the SMOS-Box is comprised of four tools:
    <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt="Grid point data table icon"/>
    the grid point data table,
    <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt="Grid point flag matrix icon"/>
    the grid point flag matrix diagram,
    <img src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png" alt="Brightness temperature chart icon"/>
    the grid point brightness temperature chart, and
    <img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png" alt="Snapshot information tool icon"/>
    the snapshot information tool. The tools can be invoked by clicking on the corresponding icons arranged in
    the SMOS-Box toolbar shown below.
</p>

<p>
    <img src="images/smos-toolbar.png" alt="SMOS Toolbar"/>
</p>

<p>
    By default the SMOS-Box toolbar is located next to the standard VISAT toolbar .
</p>

<h5>
    Opening a SMOS product and displaying image data
</h5>

<p>
    When a SMOS product is opened in VISAT, the list of available band data is displayed in the <strong>Products
    View</strong>.
    Double-clicking onto a band name opens a window displaying the band data as an image (see the screenshots below).
    Due to the BEAM data model used internally to represent all EO data products, it is required to resample SMOS L1C
    and L2 gridded data to rectangular raster data. The images created from SMOS products in BEAM thus use the
    Geographic WGS-84 coordinate reference system.
</p>

<p>
    The geo-coding of all SMOS data products is provided by the same WGS-84 geographic coordinate reference system.
    The mapping between image pixels and SMOS grid points is established by a lookup table being a raster dataset
    of 16384 by 8192 image pixels, yielding about 30 image pixels for an equatorial grid cell of the ISEA4H-R9 grid.
</p>

<p>
    For SMOS L1c Science products the image displayed by default when double-clicking on a band is computed on-the-fly.
    Actually, the image is computed from the snapshot data in the same manner as a Browse product is computed from the
    corresponding Science product.

<h5>
    <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt="Grid point data table icon"/> Using the grid point data table
</h5>

<p>
    The grid point data table tool can be invoked by clicking on the <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png"
                                                                          alt="Grid point data table icon"/> icon in the
    SMOS-Box toolbar. The table shows all measurements made for the currently selected grid point, with a single
    measurement record per row. By default the selected grid point is defined by the position of the mouse pointer.
    By activating the <strong>Snap to selected pin</strong> option the selected grid point may also be defined by the
    position of a currently selected pin.
</p>

<p>
    The measurements displayed in the table columns can be explicitly choosen by clicking on the
    <strong>Columns...</strong>
    button, which pops up a dialog for selecting or deselecting individual measurements. The whole table can be exported
    to character-separated text, either stored in a file or the clipboard.

</p>

<h5>
    <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt="Grid point flag matrix icon"/> Using the grid point flag matrix
</h5>

<p>
    The grid point flag matrix tool can be invoked by clicking on the <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png"
                                                                           alt="Grid point flag matrix icon"/> icon in
    the SMOS-Box toolbar. The flag matrix shows all flags associated with measurement records acquired for the currently
    selected grid point, with a single measurement record per column and a single flag per row. A raised flag is
    indicated by a coloured entry in the flag matrix. By default the selected grid point is defined by
    the position of the mouse pointer. By activating the <strong>Snap to selected pin</strong> option the selected grid
    point may also be defined by the position of a currently selected pin.
</p>

<h5>
    <img src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png" alt="Brightness temperature chart icon"/> Using the grid point brightness
    temperature chart
</h5>

<p>
    The grid point brightness temperature chart tool can be invoked by clicking on the <img
        src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png"
        alt="Brightness temperature chart icon"/>
    icon in the SMOS-Box toolbar. The brightness temperature chart shows a diagram of the brightness temperatures
    measured for the currently selected grid point. A single series of brightness temperatures versus incidence angle is
    shown for each polarisation mode. By default the selected grid point is defined by the position of the mouse
    pointer. By activating the <strong>Snap to selected pin</strong> option the selected grid
    point may also be defined by the position of a currently selected pin.
</p>

<p>
    For the brightness temperature measurements made in the X and Y copolarisation modes the uncertainties are shown as
    error bars. The display of individual polarisation modes can be switched on and off by activating or deactivating
    the corresponding checkboxes.

<h5>
    <img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png" alt="Snapshot information tool icon"/> Using the snapshot information tool
</h5>

<p>
    The snapshot information tool can be invoked by clicking on the <img
        src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png"
        alt="Brightness temperature chart icon"/>
    icon in the SMOS-Box toolbar. The tool can be used for browsing the 'Swath Snapshot List' contained in the SMOS L1c
    Science products. The components of this tool are described below.
</p>

<h6>
    Spinner component
</h6>

<p>
    For selecting an individual snapshot the tool provides a spinner which allows to manually specify a certain snapshot
    ID and to navigate forward and backward in the list of snapshot IDs.
</p>


<h6>
    Slider component
</h6>

<p>
    The slider provides an explicit mechanism for fast navigation through the list of snapshot IDs.
</p>

<h6>
    Combobox component
</h6>

<p>
    The combobox provides a facility for selecting a certain polarisation mode (any, H, V, HV). When a
    certain mode is selected, only IDs of snapshots acquired at the selected mode are navigable (i.e. IDs of snapshots
    acquired at a different mode do not appear in the list of snapshot IDs) by the spinner and slider components.
</p>


<h6>
    Table component
</h6>

<p>
    While navigating through the snapshots, the corresponding 'Snapshot Information' like TEC and
    geomagnetic field, etc. are displayed in a table.
</p>

<h6>
    Synchronise checkbox
</h6>

<!-- TODO: review text below --> 

<p>
    Enabled only when there is an active product scene view (PSV). Synchronising implies:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The combobox component is disabled while its value is set to the polarisation mode of the band displayed in the
        active view.
    </li>
    <li>
        Only IDs of snapshots acquired at the selected polarisation mode are navigable.
    </li>
    <li>
        The radio buttons (see below) are enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        The 'follow checkbox' is enabled.
    </li>
    <li>
        The 'locate button' is enabled.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Changing the active PSV while being in synchonised mode implies:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        The value of the combobox is set to the polarisation mode of the band displayed in the active view.
        Only IDs of snapshots acquired at the selected polarisation mode are navigable.
    </li>
    <li>
        When the selected snapshot ID is not navigable, the nearest navigable snapshot becomes selected unless the
        active PSV is associated with a snapshot ID which then becomes selected.
    </li>
</ol>

<h6>Radio buttons</h6>

<p>
    There are two radio buttons for selection the raster data source for the active PSV.
    Selecting the 'Snapshot' radio button implies that, firstly, the active PSV shows the raster data of the selected
    snapshot instead of the browse, and, secondly, the band displayed in the active PSV becomes associated with the
    ID of the selected snapshot.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the 'Browse' radio button implies that, firstly,
    the active PSV shows the raster data of the browse instead of the selected snapshot, and, secondly,
    the band displayed in the active PSV is not associated with a snapshot.
</p>

<h6>
    Follow checkbox
</h6>

<p>
    When checked the viewport of the active PSV automatically zooms to the region of the selected
    snapshot.
</p>
<h6>
    Locate button
</h6>

<p>
    When pressed the viewport of the active PSV zooms to the region of the selected snapshot.
