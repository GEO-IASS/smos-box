<h3>SMOS Tools</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
    The SMOS-Box is a collection of tools which aim at providing facilities for visualisation and basic
    analysis of SMOS Level 1 and 2 Data Products which fully complies with the BEAM Toolbox.
    Technical objective is the development of BEAM compliant software modules – all distributed under
    the GNU General Public License – for visualisation of measurement values, errors, flags and supplementary data
    contained in SMOS User Data Products (UDPs) as well as for advanced plotting and charting of data contained
    in the UDPs, and for exporting UDP data to alternative image and EO data formats.
</p>

<p>
    This document provides the online help for Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box, which is preliminary software released and
    distributed for the purpose of obtaining user feedback and additional user requirements at an early stage of
    development.

<h4>Capabilities</h4>

<p>

</p>

<h4>Limitations</h4>

<p>
    Besides issues related to runtime performance, Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box has the following limitations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        All SMOS data products are represented as global products covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore
        SMOS products do not have a geographical boundary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to the representation of SMOS products as a global product, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes
        crossing the anti-meridian.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting a displayed SMOS image results in an out-of-memory error. The VISAT application must be restarted
        in order to recover from this error.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some map projections do not work with SMOS products. Those projections which do work need too much time in
        order to complete the calculations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting a SMOS product as BEAM-DIMAP, HDF5 or GeoTIFF does not work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        The graphical user interface occasionally is not responsive while working with SMOS products.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Usage</h4>

<p>
    Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box is comprised of four tools:
    <img src="images/SmosGridPoint16.png" alt="Icon"/>
    the grid point brightness temperature data table,
    <img src="images/SmosFlags16.png" alt="Icon"/>
    the grid point brightness temperature flag matrix diagram,
    <img src="images/SmosBtGraph16.png" alt="Icon"/>
    the grid point brightness temperature chart, and
    <img src="images/SmosSnapshot16.png" alt="Icon"/>
    the snapshot information tool. The tools can be invoked by clicking on the corresponding icons arranged in
    the SMOS-Box toolbar shown below.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
    By default the SMOS-Box toolbar (right column of icons) is located next to the standard VISAT toolbar (left column
    of icons).
