<h3>SMOS Tools</h3>

<h4>Introduction</h4>

<p>
    The SMOS-Box is a collection of tools which aim at providing facilities for visualisation and basic
    analysis of SMOS Level 1 and 2 Data Products which fully complies with the BEAM Toolbox.
    Technical objective is the development of BEAM compliant software modules – all distributed under
    the GNU General Public License – for visualisation of measurement values, errors, flags and supplementary data
    contained in SMOS User Data Products (UDPs) as well as for advanced plotting and charting of data contained
    in the UDPs, and for exporting UDP data to alternative image and EO data formats.

<p>
    This document provides the online help for Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box, which is preliminary software released and
    distributed for the purpose of obtaining user feedback and additional user requirements at an early stage of
    development.
