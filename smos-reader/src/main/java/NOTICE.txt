The source tree contains a copy of the entire source code of the 'edu.ucar:bufr'
Maven artifact version 4.3.22, including BUFR table resources.

For updating to a newer version, replace the contents of the 'ucar.nc2' package
and the BUFR tables in 'resources.bufrTables' with the corresponding contents of
the newer version.

Be sure to keep and adapt the 'ucar.nc2.iosp.bufr.SmosBufrIosp' class, which has
been added to the 'ucar.nc2.iosp.bufr' package by Brockmann Consult GmbH.
