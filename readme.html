<h1>About the BEAM SMOS-Box, Version 2.0</h1>

<hr/>

<a name="intro"/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The BEAM SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order to support users of data
    acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission. The SMOS-Box software
    is developed by
    <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a>, under
    <a href="http://www.esa.int/">ESA</a> contract
    initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated by Peter Regner (ESRIN).
</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<h3>Supported Products</h3>

<p>
    Version 2.0 of the BEAM SMOS-Box is capable of reading SMOS data products complying with Schemas
    Release 2010-02-12_v04-04-06. The product types supported are listed in the table below.

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>
    Version 2.0 of the SMOS-Box includes five SMOS-specific tools:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Grid point brightness temperature data table: all measurements made
        for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a
        table.
    </li>
    <li>
        Grid point brightness temperature flag matrix diagram: all flags
        associated with the measurements made for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer
        or a selected pin are displayed in a flag matrix
    </li>
    <li>
        Grid point brightness temperature chart: All brightness temperatures
        measured for the grid point selected by either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed
        in a chart
    </li>
    <li>
        Snapshot information tool: information for all snapshots contained in a
        Level-1c Science product can be browsed with a slider
    </li>
    <li>
        Grid point export tool: exports all data for a user-defined set of SMOS
        grid points into a plain text file
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
    Version 2.0 of the SMOS-Box has the following known limitations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        All SMOS data products are represented as global products covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore
        SMOS products do not have a geographical boundary
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to the representation of SMOS products as global products, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes
        crossing the anti-meridian
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point
        data
    </li>
</ul>
