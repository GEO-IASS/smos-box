<h1>About the BEAM SMOS-Box Version 0.5</h1>

<hr/>

<a name="into"/>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
    The BEAM SMOS-Box project has been brought into life in order to support users of data
    acquired by ESA's Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission.
</p>

<p>
    Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box is preliminary software released and distributed for the
    purpose of obtaining user feedback and additional user requirements at an early stage
    of development.
</p>

<p>
    The SMOS-Box is developed under
    <a href="http://www.esa.int/">ESA</a> contract
    initiated by Steven Delwart (ESTEC) and coordinated by Peter Regner (ESRIN).
    The SMOS-Box software is developed by
    <a href="http://www.brockmann-consult.de/">Brockmann Consult</a> (BEAM Team).
</p>

<h2>Capabilities</h2>

<h4>Supported Products</h4>

<p>
    Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box is capable of reading SMOS user data products complying with Schemas Release
    2009-02-10_v04-03-00:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Level-1c Browse Full and Dual Polarisation</dt>
    <dd>
        All measurements contained in the <code>BT_Data_Type</code> record are converted into BEAM bands.
    </dd>
    <dt>Level-1c Science Full and Dual Polarisation</dt>
    <dd>
        All measurements contained in the <code>BT_Data_Type</code> record are converted into BEAM bands. For each
        band, the user can choose whether the band data should be provided by a snapshot or a browse-equivalent which
        is computed on-the-fly. The latter is the default.
    </dd>
    <dt>Level-2 Ocean Salinity UDP</dt>
    <dd>
        All measurements provided in the <code>Grid_Point_Data_Type</code>
        record and the enclosed record types are converted into BEAM bands.
    </dd>
    <dt>Level-2 Surface Moisture UDP</dt>
    <dd>
        All measurements provided in the <code>Grid_Point_Data_Type</code>
        record and the enclosed record types are converted into BEAM bands.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Tools</h4>

<p>
    Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box also includes four SMOS-specific tools:
</p>

<dl>
    <dt>Grid point brightness temperature data table</dt>
    <dd>
        All measurements acquired for the grid point determined by either
        the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a table.
    </dd>
    <dt>Grid point brightness temperature flag matrix</dt>
    <dd>
        The flags associated with the measurements made for the grid point
        determined by either the mouse pointer or a
        selected pin are displayed in a flag matrix.
    </dd>
    <dt>Grid point brightness temperature chart</dt>
    <dd>
        The brightness temperatures acquired for the grid point determined by
        either the mouse pointer or a selected pin are displayed in a chart.
    </dd>
    <dt>Snapshot information tool</dt>
    <dd>
        Information for all snapshots contained in a Level-1c Science product
        can be browsed with a slider. When synchronised with the current view,
        the slider can be used to select a snapshot providing the band data
        for the view.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>
    Version 0.5 of the SMOS-Box has the following limitations:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        All SMOS data products are represented as global products covering the whole surface of the Earth. Therefore
        SMOS products do not have a geographical boundary.
    </li>
    <li>
        Due to the representation of SMOS products as a global product, it is not possible to draw lines or shapes
        crossing the anti-meridian.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting a displayed SMOS image results in an out-of-memory error. The VISAT application must be restarted
        in order to recover from this error.
    </li>
    <li>
        Some map projections do not work with SMOS products. Those projections which do work need too much time in
        order to complete the calculations.
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting a SMOS product as BEAM-DIMAP, HDF5 or GeoTIFF does not work.
    </li>
    <li>
        Statistics, scatter plots, histograms and profile plots use image pixel data rather than SMOS grid point
        data.
    </li>
    <li>
        The brightness temperature measurements are not transformed into the earth-fixed frame yet.
    </li>
    <li>
        The graphical user interface occasionally is less responsive while working with SMOS products.
    </li>
    <li>
        The default coloring used for displaying Level-2 bands is not adequate yet.
    </li>
</ul>
